# Kitchen Inventory Project

This project is a work-in-progress using .NET and C# to build an application to track inventory of kitchen items at home. Currently contains entity models from a SQL database and an ASP.NET Core Web Api project where new Condiments and Seasonings (two current DB tables) can be manipulated using CRUD principles.
